          "Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.",
          "In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken cubes and cook until lightly browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.",
          "In the same skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.",
          "Sprinkle flour over the onion and garlic, stirring constantly for 1 minute to create a roux.",
          "Gradually whisk in warm milk and chicken broth until the sauce thickens and is smooth. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low.",
          "Stir in cream cheese until fully melted and smooth. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese and 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese until melted and well combined. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.",
          "Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the cheese sauce. Stir to coat the chicken evenly.",
          "Pour the chicken and sauce mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with additional shredded mozzarella cheese on top.",
          "Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and golden brown. If desired, broil for the last 2-3 minutes for an extra crispy topping (watch carefully!).",
          "Remove from oven, let stand for 5 minutes, then garnish with fresh chopped parsley before serving."

This recipe is a true weeknight winner, combining tender chicken, flavorful garlic, and a luscious creamy sauce that coats every strand of pasta. It's a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, even for the pickiest eaters.",
          "The secret to this dish lies in its simplicity. We're using readily available ingredients and straightforward techniques to create a meal that's both satisfying and impressive. Don't be fooled by the short ingredient list – each component plays a vital role in building the overall flavor profile. From the golden-brown chicken to the fragrant garlic and the rich cream sauce, every bite is an explosion of deliciousness.",
          "One of the best things about this recipe is its versatility. Feel free to customize it to your liking. Add some chopped vegetables like spinach, broccoli, or bell peppers for extra nutrients and texture. You can also experiment with different types of pasta – penne, fettuccine, or even rotini would work perfectly. And for a little extra kick, try adding a pinch of red pepper flakes to the sauce.",
          "Choosing the right pasta is key. While any pasta will technically work, I highly recommend using a long pasta shape like spaghetti or linguine. These shapes allow the creamy sauce to cling to every strand, ensuring a perfect bite every time. When cooking the pasta, be sure to cook it al dente – slightly firm to the bite – as it will continue to cook slightly in the sauce.",
          "To ensure the chicken is cooked through and juicy, make sure to cut it into even-sized pieces before cooking. This will help it cook evenly and prevent it from drying out. I like to use chicken breast for this recipe, but you can also use chicken thighs for a richer flavor. Remember to season the chicken generously with salt, pepper, and any other spices you enjoy.",
          "The creamy garlic sauce is what truly makes this dish special. The key is to cook the garlic gently over low heat to avoid burning it. Burnt garlic can have a bitter taste, which will ruin the flavor of the sauce. Once the garlic is fragrant, add the cream and Parmesan cheese and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly. Be careful not to boil the sauce, as this can cause it to separate.",
          "Garnish your Chicken Garlic Pasta with fresh parsley or basil for a pop of color and freshness. Serve immediately and enjoy! This recipe is also great for meal prepping. Simply store the pasta and sauce separately and combine them when you're ready to eat. Reheat gently over low heat or in the microwave."
